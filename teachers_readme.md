## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with OpenEDU is to use [DownGit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download the folder(s) you want. For example, if you want the whole 11th-grade folder, navigate to that folder (/curriculum/11) in Github, then paste the link (https://github.com/misterbastean/OpenEDU/tree/main/curriculum/11) into DownGit, then click the "Download" button. This will download a .zip file of that folder's contents.

See this short video for a demonstration: (TODO: add video guide)
