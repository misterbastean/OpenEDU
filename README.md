# OpenEDU
OpenEDU is an ongoing project designed to create an open-source, completely free curriculum that K-12 schools can implement in order to eliminate their reliance on expensive, largely ineffective textbook companies.

## Why OpenEDU Exists
Currently, there are major problems with the educational resource industry (e.g. textbooks, assessments, etc.), the most egregious of which are exorbitant costs and far too much "filler" content. The purpose of OpenEDU is to create a free alternative that is maintained by the teaching community, with updates being peer-reviewed in order to maintain high standards.

## Brief History
Dr. Josh Bastean started working on OpenEDU when he noticed that the current educational resources industry has many similarities to the software industry in the 1990s. Specifically, software was proprietary and extremely expensive, resulting in high costs, low innovation, and a culture focused on limiting access. This is very similar to the current curriculum industry, which focuses on creating extremely expensive resources (especially textbooks) that are rarely updated in any meaningful way, resulting in high costs, low innovation, and a culture focused on limiting access.

However, the software industry has largely shifted away from closed-source, proprietary software to the open-source model. There are many benefits to this model, including vastly reduced costs and much more innovation, resulting in greatly improved software. OpenEDU is an attempt to create a curriculum that is a free, high-quality alternative to the current offerings in order to allow school districts to save that money and use it to better help students.

## Contributing
OpenEDU cannot exist without educator contributions. Creating and maintaining a high-quality K-12 curriculum is a large undertaking - much more than one person (or even a handful of people) could ever do with any degree of success. However, this is one of the main strengths of open-source systems: many hands make light work.

There are a wide variety of ways to contribute to OpenEDU, such as sharing resources (e.g. graphic organizers, teaching strategies, assessments, etc.), updating resources, copy-editing, etc. Please see the "Contributing.md" document for more information on how you can use your expertise to improve OpenEDU for everyone.
